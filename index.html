          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p> My interests are web design, computer security and software development, particularly in the areas of secure protocols, cryptography, privacy, and anonymity. But I also secretly hate technology, and the direction its going.
    I hope to contribute to a world where we value expeirences and relationships over careers and money, where we know better than to trust authority blindly, and where we're passionate about building and creating things in a self-motivated and self-directed way.
    Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.</p>

  <p> "My interests are web design, computer security and software development, particularly in the areas of secure protocols, cryptography, privacy, and anonymity. But I also secretly hate technology, and the direction its going.
I hope to contribute to a world where we value expeirences and relationships over careers and money, where we know better than to trust authority blindly, and where we're passionate about building and creating things in a self-motivated and self-directed way."</p>
